# Reddit Image Downloader

This is a simple script that downloads images from subreddits.
In this case, it is used to download images from the subreddit [/r/ArchitecturePorn](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArchitecturePorn/) and [/r/Houseporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/Houseporn/). First you need to download the subreddit dumps from academic torrents, then you can make some queries to filter the data (in my case get the images related to country) and finally download the images.
